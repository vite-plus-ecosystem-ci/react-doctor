 *
 * Every candidate directory — the scan root and each workspace package — is

 * vulnerable `next` in one workspace isn't masked by an inert one elsewhere).
 * Next.js vendors its own RSC runtime, so an affected `next` install in a
 * directory is reported by its `next` version (the fix is a Next.js bump) and
 * suppresses the standalone `react-server-dom-*` check for that directory only;
 * every other framework or bundler — Vite, Parcel, React Router, Waku,
 * RedwoodSDK — is reported by its `react-server-dom-*` version. Dispatch keys
 * on resolved installs rather than the root framework classification, so a
 * monorepo whose root is Vite but whose workspace runs Next.js is still
 * covered. Pure client-side React apps (no RSC packages, no Next.js) are not
 * affected and stay quiet.
