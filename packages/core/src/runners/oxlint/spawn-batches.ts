 *   ENFILE / ENOMEM — see `isParallelismRelatedSpawnError`), the whole
 *   pass replays once with a single worker. That's the only failure a

 *   propagate.
 * - Files dropped because oxlint's native binding SIGABRT'd under
 *   memory pressure (`OxlintBatchExceeded { kind: "oom" }`) get one
 *   serial single-file-batch rescue pass: the OOM is usually a function
 *   of N concurrent oxlint allocator arenas, not the file itself, so a
 *   lone process with the machine to itself typically clears it —
 *   turning a partial scan into a complete (if slower) one.
 *
 * Errors that aren't splittable and aren't parallelism-related (oxlint
