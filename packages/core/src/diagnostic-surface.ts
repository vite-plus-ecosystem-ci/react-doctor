 * Built-in surface exclusions applied before any user config.
 *
 * `design`-tagged rules are weak-signal style cleanup — they still ship
 * to the local CLI so developers see them while editing, but they're
 * removed from the PR comment surface, the score, and the CI gate so
 * they can't bury real React findings or fail a build over a Tailwind
 * shorthand. Diagnostics from test and story files likewise remain in
 * raw output while staying out of the production-health score and CI
 * gate. Override per-surface via `config.surfaces.<surface>` to promote
 * individual rules back in by tag, category, or rule id.
