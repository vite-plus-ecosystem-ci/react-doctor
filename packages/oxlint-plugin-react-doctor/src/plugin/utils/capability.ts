// The capability vocabulary: every token a project can expose, in one
// typed union. @react-doctor/core's `buildCapabilities` (a pure projection
// over its ProjectInfo) is the only emitter; rules consume tokens at config
// time via `Rule.requires` / `Rule.disabledWhen` and at runtime via
// `hasCapability`. Typing both ends against this union makes a misspelled
// token a compile error instead of a silently never-matching gate.
//
// Mirrors core's `Framework` union — core aliases its `Framework` type to
// `FrameworkToken` (core depends on this package, never the reverse), so
// the two cannot drift.
