// time via `Rule.requires` / `Rule.disabledWhen` and at runtime via
// `hasCapability`. Typing both ends against this union makes a misspelled
// token a compile error instead of a silently never-matching gate.

// `FrameworkToken` (core depends on this package, never the reverse), so
// the two cannot drift.
